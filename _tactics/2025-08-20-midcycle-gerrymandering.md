Redrawing electoral maps outside of the usual census-driven cycle — or exerting intense political pressure on legislators to do so — is a tactic aimed at entrenching partisan advantage and undermining voters' ability to choose their representatives.

## How it works
- Identify politically favorable redistricting opportunities and assemble legislative allies.
- Apply public and private pressure (threats, promises of support, endorsements) to speed passage.
- Pass maps quickly with limited public input and minimal transparency, then implement before electoral consequences are fully understood.

## Why it matters
- Erodes fairness in representation and can entrench a party beyond its electoral support.
- Reduces public trust in elections and governing institutions.

## Defensive measures
- Legal constraints: enforce redistricting rules and judicial review for maps drawn without proper procedure.
- Transparency: require public hearings, independent commissions, or clear criteria for map drawing.
- Civic engagement: watchdogging and rapid response from civil society when mid-cycle efforts emerge.

## Violated Principles

### Free and Fair Elections
- Mid-cycle redistricting manipulates electoral boundaries to advantage a party, reducing the competitiveness and fairness of elections.

### Accountability and Transparency
- Rapid, closed-door map changes deny the public oversight and debate necessary to legitimate electoral rules.
