Actors can use symbolic acts — like executive orders, renamings, or persistent rhetoric — to recast ordinary civil institutions in militarized terms. The aim is often to shift public perception, justify authoritarian measures, or make aggressive policy choices feel routine and inevitable.

How it works
- Issue an executive order or public messaging that replaces neutral institutional language with militarized language (e.g., "Department of War" instead of "Department of Defense").
- Amplify the new terminology across official channels, social media, and allied media outlets to normalize the change.
- Use the rebranded language to justify harder-line policies and to create a perception that exceptional measures are standard policy.

Why it matters
- Symbolic changes shape public expectations and legitimize harsher approaches to policy.
- They can be a prelude to substantive changes that concentrate power or expand executive authority.

Defensive measures
- Legal clarity: reinforce statutory naming and require congressional approval for substantive institutional changes.
- Oversight and transparency: demand clear policy rationales, cost estimates, and hearings for any major rebranding or structural change.
- Public communication: rapid fact-checking and explanatory reporting to prevent normalization of militarized terminology.

## Violated Principles

### Rule of Law
- Naming and structural changes to statutory institutions without proper legislative process can exceed executive authority and erode legal constraints.

### Separation of Powers
- Unilateral rebranding or repurposing of institutions can bypass Congress and weaken the checks and balances meant to prevent executive overreach.

### Accountability and Transparency
- Symbolic changes performed without hearings, clear rationale, or oversight reduce transparency and make it harder to hold officials accountable.
