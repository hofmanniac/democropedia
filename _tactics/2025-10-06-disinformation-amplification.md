Coordinated efforts to create and amplify false narratives — through bots, fake accounts, and sympathetic influencers — erode trust in news, institutions, and elections. This tactic often aims to depress turnout among certain groups, inflame distrust, or create confusion about basic facts.

## Why it matters

- Undermines informed consent of the governed.
- Polarizes communities around false premises.
- Makes accountability harder when facts are obscured.

## Defensive measures

- Platform transparency and labeling of known coordinated networks.
- Stronger media literacy and trusted public information campaigns.
- Legal and policy tools to deter foreign and domestic coordinated manipulation.

## Violated Principles

### Free and Fair Elections
- Disinformation distorts the informational environment voters need to make informed choices, depresses turnout among targeted groups, and can manipulate perceptions of electoral integrity.

### Freedom of the Press
- Coordinated false narratives can silence or drown out reliable journalism, making it harder for the press to hold power to account.

### Accountability and Transparency
- When facts are obscured or manipulated, oversight and public scrutiny become ineffective, reducing accountability.
