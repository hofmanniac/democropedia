# Rule of Law

**Rule of law** means that everyone—citizens and leaders alike—is subject to the law, and that laws are applied fairly, consistently, and impartially. This principle is the foundation of justice and order in a democracy.

## Definition

Rule of law means:

- No one is above the law, including government officials and institutions.
- Laws are clear, publicized, and stable, and apply equally to all.
- Legal processes are fair, transparent, and protect individual rights.
- Courts and law enforcement act independently and without political interference.

## Historical Context

The concept of the rule of law dates back to Magna Carta (1215), which limited the power of the king and established that even rulers must obey the law. In the United States, the Constitution and Bill of Rights enshrine legal protections and checks on power. Over time, landmark Supreme Court cases—such as Marbury v. Madison (judicial review), Brown v. Board of Education (equal protection), and United States v. Nixon (limits on executive power)—have reinforced the rule of law.

The rule of law has been tested during times of crisis, such as war, civil unrest, or political scandal. Its resilience is a measure of a democracy’s strength.

## Real-World Examples

**Upholding the Principle:**
- Courts striking down unconstitutional laws or executive actions.
- Independent investigations into official misconduct.
- Peaceful resolution of disputes through the legal system, not violence or intimidation.

**Threats and Violations:**
- Attempts to place leaders or officials above the law.
- Political interference in judicial or law enforcement processes.
- Unequal application of laws based on race, wealth, or political power.

## Why It Matters

The rule of law protects individual rights, ensures accountability, and prevents the abuse of power. When laws are applied fairly and leaders are held to the same standards as everyone else, trust in democracy grows. When the rule of law is undermined, justice and freedom are at risk.
