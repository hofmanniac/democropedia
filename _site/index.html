      <p><strong>Democratic principles</strong> are the foundational ideas that support a free, fair, and just society governed by the people. These aren’t tied to any political party — they’re the basic rules of the democratic game. They are what allow us to disagree, vote, protest, and still live together under one system.</p>

<p>They include things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free and fair elections</li>
  <li>Rule of law</li>
  <li>Civil liberties</li>
  <li>Separation of powers</li>
  <li>Accountability and transparency</li>
  <li>Protection of minority rights</li>
  <li>Peaceful transfer of power</li>
  <li>Freedom of the press</li>
</ul>

<p>These principles are embedded in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, landmark legislation, and generations of civic tradition. They’re not “left” or “right” — they’re <em>American</em>.</p>

<p>It’s important not to confuse <em>democratic principles</em> with the principles of the <strong>Democratic Party</strong>. While political parties may champion some of these ideals more than others at different times, the core principles of democracy should transcend party lines. Defending them is not a partisan act — it’s a civic one.</p>

<p>This project aims to document and defend those principles, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Defining each one clearly</li>
  <li>Connecting them to real-world examples — past and present</li>
  <li>Calling out where they are upheld</li>
  <li>And where they’re being violated or threatened</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a living, evolving effort — because democracy isn’t something we inherit. It’s something we <em>do</em>.</p>
