On September 4–5, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to refer to the Department of Defense using the alternate name “Department of War,” and to refer to the Secretary of Defense as “Secretary of War” in official and ceremonial contexts. While the official legal name remains unchanged without an act of Congress, Trump suggested that such approval may be unnecessary.

This action raises significant constitutional and democratic concerns, both for what it attempts **procedurally** and for what it signals **symbolically**.

## 🧱 Violated Democratic Principles and Norms

### 🔹 **Rule of Law**
- The Department of Defense was created by statute, and its name can only be changed by Congress.
- Attempting to unilaterally rename a federal department may exceed the scope of executive authority.

### 🔹 **Separation of Powers**
- The executive order circumvents the legislative process, undermining Congress’s exclusive power to pass laws, including naming federal departments.

### 🔹 **Accountability and Transparency**
- The rebranding lacks a clear policy purpose and evades public scrutiny regarding cost, necessity, or implications.
- Critics suggest it’s performative rather than functional, distracting from pressing oversight needs in defense policy.

### 🔹 **Democratic Norm: Responsible Executive Communication**
- Replacing the term “Defense” with “War” escalates the tone of U.S. military posture, potentially normalizing aggression.
- Language and symbolism matter — this shift embraces a combative, authoritarian aesthetic without public debate or consensus.

## 🧠 Summary

While the executive order may not have immediate legal consequences, it crosses important **normative and constitutional boundaries**. It reflects a broader pattern of the executive branch asserting unilateral authority, minimizing legislative input, and using militaristic rhetoric to reframe the role of the U.S. government — all of which threaten democratic restraint.
