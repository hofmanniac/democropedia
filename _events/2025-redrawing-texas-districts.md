In mid-2025, former President Donald Trump reportedly pressured Texas Republican lawmakers to redraw the state’s congressional districts — not as part of the normal post-census redistricting process, but in a **mid-decade political maneuver**. The goal: to gain additional Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterms.

This redistricting push occurred **during the caucus cycle**, and was accompanied by a warning from Trump to lawmakers that he was “watching closely” who supported the plan.

Governor Greg Abbott signed the redrawn map into law on **August 29, 2025**, potentially giving Republicans up to five additional seats.

## 🧱 Violated Democratic Principles and Norms

### 🔹 **Free and Fair Elections**
- Redistricting should not be manipulated mid-cycle to favor one party.
- Fair elections require that voters choose their representatives — not the other way around.
- **Relevant Norm Violated**: *Redistricting is carried out fairly, not weaponized for partisan entrenchment.*

### 🔹 **Accountability and Transparency**
- Rapid, closed-door redistricting under political pressure undermines transparency.
- Lawmakers acted at the urging of a former president, not through public deliberation or democratic input.
- **Relevant Norm Violated**: *Electoral processes must be transparent and accountable to the public, not partisan figures.*

### 🔹 **No Abuse of State Power for Political Advantage**
- The use of legislative power to redraw maps mid-decade — outside normal census cycles — suggests electoral manipulation, not neutral governance.
- **Relevant Norm Violated**: *State power should not be used to entrench a party or leader in power.*

## 🧠 Summary

Former President Trump’s effort to pressure Texas lawmakers into redrawing congressional districts mid-cycle represents a **norm-breaking attempt to manipulate electoral rules for partisan advantage**. While redistricting is legally permitted in many states at any time, **the violation here lies in the erosion of democratic norms** — fairness, independence, and restraint — that maintain public trust in elections.

This kind of mid-decade gerrymandering, especially at the urging of a single national figure, sets a dangerous precedent that elections can be engineered in real time for political gain — not determined by the will of the people.
