description: "A general overview of the core democratic principles."
---

**Democratic principles** are the foundational ideas that support a free, fair, and just society governed by the people. These aren’t tied to any political party — they’re the basic rules of the democratic game. They are what allow us to disagree, vote, protest, and still live together under one system.

They include things like:

- Free and fair elections  
- Rule of law  
- Civil liberties  
- Separation of powers  
- Accountability and transparency  
- Protection of minority rights  
- Peaceful transfer of power  
- Freedom of the press

These principles are embedded in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, landmark legislation, and generations of civic tradition. They’re not “left” or “right” — they’re *American*.

It’s important not to confuse *democratic principles* with the principles of the **Democratic Party**. While political parties may champion some of these ideals more than others at different times, the core principles of democracy should transcend party lines. Defending them is not a partisan act — it’s a civic one.

This project aims to document and defend those principles, by:

- Defining each one clearly  
- Connecting them to real-world examples — past and present  
- Calling out where they are upheld  
- And where they’re being violated or threatened  

This is a living, evolving effort — because democracy isn’t something we inherit. It’s something we *do*.
